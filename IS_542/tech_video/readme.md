# Functional Contact Form with Google App Script
This is the code I used for a tutorial about using Google App Script and contact forms available at: [https://youtu.be/INkY93oDXpg](https://youtu.be/INkY93oDXpg).  
## Technologies 
The following technologies are used in the project:
- Google App Script (serverless functions)
- JS Fetch API
- HTML
- Bootstrap & CSS
## Notes
The following is information that I did not have time to cover in my tutorial:
- You can only send about 600 emails a day with gmail. 
- Google App Script has a 20,000 HTTP requests per day limit.  
- Everytime you update your Google App Script, and are ready to use it in production, you will need to redeploy it. Deploying your app script will cause a new ID to be created. Make sure you update your form with this ID.
