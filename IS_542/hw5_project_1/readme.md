# The Scriptures, Mapped
 The Bible can be sometimes pretty dull and obscure. Bring an extra level of excitement to your kids by showing them exactly where events happen in the bible. Gain a better understanding of what it was like to live in the Promised Land at the time of Christ.

## My Experiance With Project 2
- It was really hard to get the layout working properly with all of the animations
- I wish I had structured my code a little better before starting in on the problem because my code turned into a jungle
- It was great asking my wife for UI thoughts and impressions. She helped me see what I could do to make it better 
- I had to really understand flex box as I was having some positioning problems. Learnign it made me more productive
- I am now a lot more confidant with my CSS skills. While I do not realy enjoy CSS, it is great to see a finished product come to life
